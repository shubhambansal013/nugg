The project structure that I will follow for creating a modular component structure is as follow: 

/src
	/components
		/FirstComponent
			/index.js
			/firstComponent.scss
		/SecondComponent
			/index.js
			/secondComponent.scss
	/presentational
		/HigherOrderComponentUsingComponents
			/index.js
			/higherOrderComponentUsingComponents.scss
	/index.js


	The component folder will have components that are using only the state but do not require to interact with the redux.
	The presentational folder has components which use the components from the component folder to create higher order components and are used to connect to redux also.

	Hence the component logic stays seperated from the applications business logic.
